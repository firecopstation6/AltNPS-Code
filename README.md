# AltNPS-Code
HTML and CSS for showing support for Alt US National Park Service protest!

## PLEASE NOTE - Work in Progress!
Currently, the **AltNPS Box** is available for easy inclusion on your web site within an ```<iframe>```. The source for the ```<iframe>``` is hosted here, on Github, from my Github web site.

I am in the process of releasing the components on the page so that you can host all elements locally on your own web server, as well as building a WordPress plugin. Please bear with me since I have other projects that require my attention.

Please watch **Watch** this repository for changes and updates!

Thanks!

##Installation Instructions
###On any website:

Simply place the following code wherever you want the box to display:

```<iframe src="https://firecopstation6.github.io/AltUSNPS-box.html" width="260" height="520" style="border: none; scrolling: no;"></iframe>```
