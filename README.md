# AltNPS-Code
HTML and CSS for showing support for Alt US National Park Service protest!

## NOTE - Work in Progress
This will eventually be expanded to include a WordPress plugin!

For the moment, I am just providing the basic CSS and HTML to add it to any website.

##Installation Instructions
###On any website:

- Download the code to your local machine.
- Create a subdirectory under your web server's root directory called AltNPS.
- Upload the AltNPS-Box.html and style-AltNPS.css files into the AltNPS subdirectory.
- Add the following line into the ```<head>``` section of the web page(s) you want the box to appear.
  - ```<link rel='stylesheet' href='style-AltNPS.css' type='text/css' media='all' />```
